# Carbon Footprint Calculator

A JavaFX application designed to help users estimate their annual carbon footprint based on their lifestyle habits, including electricity consumption, transportation, and waste generation. The application features a user-friendly, page-by-page interface and provides a visualization of the carbon footprint.

## Features

* **Page-by-Page:** Guides users through questions in a step-by-step format.
* **Intuitive Data Entry:**
    * Allows direct input of consumption data (e.g., monthly electricity in kWh).
    * Includes a simplified example for alternative input if exact numbers aren't known (e.g., estimating electricity use based on AC unit details).
* **Carbon Footprint Calculation:** Estimates annual CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) for:
    * Electricity
    * Transportation
    * Waste
* **User Interface:**
    * Modern, minimalist design with a monochrome green color palette.
    * Subtle fade animations for page transitions.
* **Error Handling:** Basic input validation and error messages.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** Core programming language.
* **JavaFX:** Framework for the graphical user interface (GUI).
* **IDE:** Developed using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
* **JDK:** OpenJDK 24.0.1 (or compatible).
* **JavaFX SDK:** Version 24.0.1 (or compatible).
